le projet du togo.

- je vais realiser une application pour rassembler les journaux.

- le problem actuel reste toujours le mode de payment. je peux y arriver
        en payant du cred. mais seulmnt ce sera pa tres ouvert.



- it is good to be able to make things like that up, but it also
        great to use things that people already made.

- what i really want to be good at actually is making games.

- loving girl friend and loving and praying God, working like
        a crazy person towards my life. it may be time to be
        serious and to start living my own life.

        - it not that making that step toward God will take me from
        things i find fun in.


        - i need to understand so many things before getting into c++

        - before getting into game programming...

        - i think i catch up a project of my own that i think interesting,
                start doing it, and when im done, i'll just put it on the
                market,,, that could be great.

        - and when i'll be doing something, even if it is simple, ill try
                to make great... with effect of the androidL.


 - i think im going to make a program that will take on the life of a university
        student... it is clear, that i think it is something big, but i should
        rather do my maximum in whatever i think is what will help me later.
